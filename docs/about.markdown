Hello, my name is [Joao Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-santos-ab774058/) and I am a bioinformatics researcher with a strong passion for data visualization, programming, and evolutionary theory.
I was born in Lisbon, Portugal, and I have a degree in Biology from the [Faculty of Sciences](https://www.fc.ul.pt/) of the [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/), where I also completed my Master's degree in Evolutionary and Developmental Biology.

I have dedicated my career to informing decision making in the field of biology through the development of innovative methods for analyzing genetic data.
This GPT designed sentence is true. But makes it sound like it was planned that way. The way i see it, my drives stem from three source: The ideas i like to play with, what i like to do as a routine, and what my background motivation is.
The first one was, for the longest time, Evolutionary Theory, but has slowly been replaced by software and UX design.
The second one is programming, the small puzzles one has to solve every day.
The third is the desire to improve world, to contribute somehow to a better future.
This combination has led me to work on a variety biological organisms, with different specific goals (Conservation, Plant Breeding, now Pathogen Surveillance).

I enjoy this diversity. One of my favorite things is when different fields intersect, for example when you manage to apply a method designed to study clusters
of stars to identify genetic clusters.

I am currently a researcher at the Portuguese NIH [INSA](https://www.insa.min-saude.pt/) where I am part of the development team of the [INSaFLU](https://insaflu.insa.pt/) project, a web-based platform for viral metagenomics detection and routine genomic surveillance.

In my free time, I enjoy drawing and reading, particularly science fiction, but also history, and some fantasy, of the Pratchian kind.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me, and I look forward to sharing my insights and experiences with you.
